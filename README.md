# SpotifyProject
**Group A** (*Justis Guin, Samuel Brumley, Joe Mitchell, & Ethan Ramsell*)

---
This project accesses Spotifyâ€™s API & the metadata it provides and displays a variety of information regarding artists, songs, the user's statistics, trends and projections, and hopes to include playback controls and live data monitoring.

This project will be split into 3 iterations, tagged and released as `0.0.1/2/3.x` - It hopes to implement an application-based GUI through JavaFX and CSS to make the end-user experience as pleasant as possible.



#### To Run:

You will need to add a file called `"configuration.properties"` to the /SpotifyProject/*** path on IntelliJ idea - this can be done by right-clicking on the "SpotifyProject" folder dropdown on the left-hand side of your screen when viewing IntelliJ. 

Go into src/main/java/edu.bsu.cs/main and click the run button to run the command line interface iteration. To run the GUI iteration, make sure Gradle is properly installed and click the Gradle elephant, then proceed to SpotifyProject/Tasks/application and click run.

If you are an instructor, the contents of this file should have been sent to you in the comments of the Final Project Iteration 2 submission on Canvas. If you are not an instructor, please contact a group member for the file's contents.

An example of how this should look on IntelliJ IDEA is shown below;
