### About:
This project accesses Spotifyâ€™s API & the metadata it provides and displays a variety of information regarding artists, songs, the user's statistics, trends, and projections, and hopes to include playback controls and live data monitoring.

This project will be split into 3 iterations, tagged and released as `0.0.1/2/3.x` - It contains a CLI (command-line interface) version and a GUI (graphical user interface) version. Usage information is detailed below. 


---
### To Run:

To run the CLI version of SpotifyProject, navigate to the Main.java file inside of `src/main/java/edu.bsu.cs/main` and click the run button to run the command line interface iteration. 

To run the GUI version of SpotifyProject, ensure Gradle is installed and updated (see version instructions below) and click the Gradle elephant, then proceed to `SpotifyProject/Tasks/application` and click run.

### Required File(s) & Environments:

You will need to add a file called `"configuration.properties"` to the /SpotifyProject/*** path on IntelliJ idea - this can be done by right-clicking on the "SpotifyProject" folder dropdown on the left-hand side of your screen when viewing IntelliJ. 


If you are an instructor, the contents of this file should have been sent to you in the comments of the Final Project Iteration 2 submission on Canvas. If you are not an instructor, please contact a group member for the file's contents.

An example of how this should look on IntelliJ IDEA is shown below;

This project was designed and intended to be run using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, `Build #IC-241.14494.240`, built on March 28, 2024

This project requires Gradle to run the GUI portion and has been tested to run with the newest version `(Gradle 8.7)` and prefers to utilize the `"Amazon Corretto 21"` JDK.
