# SpotifyProject
### Group A (Justis Guin, Samuel Brumley, Joe Mitchell, & Ethan Ramsell)
This project accesses Spotifyâ€™s API & the metadata it provides and displays a variety of information regarding artists, songs, the user's statistics, trends and projections, and hopes to include playback controls and live data monitoring.

This project will be split into 3 iterations, tagged and released as `0.0.1/2/3.x` - We hope to implement an application-based GUI through JavaFX and CSS to make the end-user experience as pleasant as possible.
